            <h2>Paris</h2>
            <p> Thomas Jefferson once said “a walk about Paris will provide lessons in history, beauty, and in the point of life.”
                Paris is Known as the “City of Light” or the “City of Love,” the streets of Paris overflow with culture, art, beauty, and history.
                Paris was originally a Roman City called “Lutetia.”
                 It’s believed that Paris only has one stop sign in the entire city.
                 The craziness of driving in Paris rivals other major cities like Rome, and you have to have nerves of steel to do so. The fact that the city only has ONE stop sign probably won’t encourage you.
                There are at least three replicas of the Statue of Liberty in Paris. The most famous of them exists on an island in the middle of the Seine and looks towards her sister statue in New York.
